## About project
This project will get you a random meme from a subreddit of your choice (may make a list of different memes subreddits, so it was easier to access)

### Related project
https://github.com/yourenoticed/r_memes_tg_bot <- telegram bot that has about the same usage case but is more convenient imo (it takes memes directly from reddit endpoints, doesn't have a db integration)
